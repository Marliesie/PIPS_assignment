# cheat()

A function to cheat on assignment 3.1 of the PIPS course.
You can get the answers for question 6, 8 and 13. They will open 
in a new script in Rstudio, so you can modify and run everything you need.

How to use:

```

```

Arguments:

question: The number of the question you want to cheat on


# make_art

This is a function to create colorful art with flowers!

This function will bring you beautiful art, different every time!. It is
generated by random numbers, but you can set the seed and reproduce your
favorite piece. The function can also let you specify the number of flowers
you want to see in your art piece.

Usage:

```
make_art(n_flowers = 50, color_wave_seed = NULL, flower_points_seed = NULL)
```

Arguments:

n_flower:           Set the number of flowers in the art piece. Default = 50.
                    Any n_flower higher than 100 must be a
                    multiple of 100

color_wave_seed:    Set the seed for the colors. Default = NULL

Flower_points_seed: Set the seed for the flowers. Default = NULL


Please note: You might get a warning (In RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n, pal) :
n too large), this will only result in the inner color being light gray, and
looks just as nice!


Example:

```
make_art(25, 2093, 1837)

```
